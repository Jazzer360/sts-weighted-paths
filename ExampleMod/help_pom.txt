Read through the pom.xml comments to see which parts of it you should change.

Before being able to use any of the libraries inside of the libs folder your IDE may ask to import
changes for maven. This will create the External Libraries for your project based on what dependencies
are inside of the pom.xml.

To build your mod type "mvn package" into the command line where the pom.xml is located. This will create a jar file
that will be your completed mod.
